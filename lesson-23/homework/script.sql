DISTINCT Id,
SUM(max_det_num) OVER (PARTITION BY ID) AS SumofMax
FROM DILTR

--6)In this puzzle you have to find difference between a and b column between each row and if the difference is not equal to 0 then show the difference i.e. a â€“ b otherwise 0. Now you need to replace this zero with blank.Please check the sample input and the expected output.

CREATE TABLE TheZeroPuzzle (
    Id INT,
    a INT,
    b INT
